# Jupyter

After being followed the instructions of how to install Jupyter notebook if you use the recommended installation that is anaconda, maybe you need some help to run it from console, without running Anaconda navigator. This should be the trick.

```text
alias notebook='/anaconda3/bin/jupyter_mac.command ; exit;'
```
